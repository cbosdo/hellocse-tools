This is a collection of tools to automate some administrator tasks for HelloCSE administrators.

* 'hellocse-diff-employees': prints the differences between the HelloCSE users and a Workday employees export.
* 'hellocse-generate-csv': create CSV files out of the HelloCSE export. Convenient to create the file for gifts vouchers.
